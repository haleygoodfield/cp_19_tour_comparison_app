# Tour Comparison App 
This is my nineteenth coding project, where I have developed a **tour comparison app** that allows you to: 
- View tour details (name, price, image, description)
- Toggle “Read More” for longer info
- Remove tours with a “Not Interested” button
- See a message when no tours are left

## Built with React, Vite, and custom CSS. 

## To Run It
1. Open terminal
2. Run "npm install"
3. Then, Run "npm run dev"
4. Click on the local host
